## 🧠 Concept: Engineered for Flow

**Zen Zone** is not just a timer or a music player. It is a **UX Psychology-driven tool** designed to reduce cognitive load and induce the "Flow State" (Zone).

By decoupling time management from environmental control, it respects your autonomy and helps you construct the perfect mental environment for deep work within Obsidian.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🍅 Focus Timer (Zen Mode)
Activate **Zen Mode** to eliminate distractions.
- **Distraction-free:** Hides sidebars and status bars automatically.
- **Visual Clarity:** Large, tabular-numeral display for instant recognition.
- **Completion Loop:** A "Session Complete" overlay utilizes the *Zeigarnik Effect* to provide closure and a moment to breathe.

### 2. 🎧 Ambient Audio Engine
Seamlessly integrate YouTube ambiances (Lofi, Jazz, Nature sounds) without leaving your notes.
- **Invisible Player:** Audio plays in the background. No ads, no distractions.
- **Decoupled Control:** Play music without the timer, or run the timer in silence. You have full control.
- **Volume Mixer:** Independent volume control separate from your system audio.

### 3. 🔖 Smart Checkpoints
Don't waste willpower searching for "the good part" of a track.
- **Quick Jump:** Define timestamps (e.g., "Bass Drop", "Morning Mood") in settings.
- **One-Tap Access:** Switch moods instantly with large, Fitts's Law-compliant buttons.

### 4. ⚙️ GUI Playlist Manager
- **No JSON Editing:** A clean, modal-based interface to manage your favorite tracks.
- **Cognitive Ease:** Visual hierarchy helps you organize titles, URLs, and checkpoints effortlessly.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This plugin was refactored by a **UX Psychology Architect** based on the following principles:

> **Gestalt Principles (Common Region)**
> Controls are grouped into distinct cards ("Timer" vs "Audio") to help your brain process information faster.

> **Von Restorff Effect**
> The primary action ("Start Focus") is visually isolated and emphasized, reducing decision fatigue.

> **Fitts's Law**
> Interactive elements like checkpoints have expanded clickable areas, making interaction fluid and error-free.
